## NonProfit

*Incorporated organizations that are nonprofit*

Nonprofits are required to submit Form 990 each year to the IRS which includes detailed financial information and salaries. They must disclose their Form 990 when asked. However, some companies go beyond this and publish more financial information on their websites. Interesting examples included here (especially software-focused projects):

* [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/about/our-finances/)
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/about/)
* [Apache Software Foundation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files-dist/AnnualReports/FY2018%20Annual%20Report.pdf)
